    "## Purpose of the below code:\n",
    "The series of cells below represent a tool that can be used in order to pull real-time pricing data from Rapid.API which is a website that consolidates API's around the web that store and maintain live housing data. The API that we have elected to used from the Rapid.API site is called APIDojo.com which consolidates housing data into an API which sources the data from Realtor.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is designed to read in a CSV file which was compiled to incorporate zip codes from the top 5 investment opportunity cities that our group identified by using a Monte Carlo simulation. Once we read in the zip data, code was built to add that data to a list in order to incorporate into a drop down list using Tkinter combobox. When you run the Combobox cell, a pop-up will appear allowing you to select a zip code from the drop down. Once the zip is selected, you must hit the \"select\" button which will store the zip into a global variable and print out what zip was selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the zip code is stored into the global vairable it will populate the API HTTP and when you run the API code it will pull all current sales listings within that zip code. Once the API is run, the final two cells of the code block will pull key metrics and data from the API out put and display into a dataframe.\n"
