## Analysis

### Recent Housing Trends 

1. The Impact of COVID on Rental Prices

COVID has negatively impacted large cities rental prices because of the dense living requirements. In non-pandemic times, these cities can offer attractive job opportunities alongside premium amenity properties, but with business closures and working from home these are no longer the best options for renters. This has forced down the cost of renting in large cities while increasing the rental costs in suburban cities nearby. It has also driven a higher price for housing as would be renters decide to buy a home instead given the current health crisis.

2. Large Cities are Unaffordable

Based on our calculation of median household income to annual rental expense, those that live in larger cities pay over 30% of their gross wages on housing. This compares to the national average of XX%. People who work in these cities may choose to live further away to reduce their cost of living, but typically suffer longer commutes and may not have access to public transportation.

3. Crime is not always in cities

Certain factors help convince people to live in a specific area. One of those is how safe the area is. There is a reason why Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs has basic needs (safety, shelter) at the bottom of the pyramid. The data suggests that crime may not always be in cities.

4. Population Growth

Most of the U.S. population growth occurs in major cities because jobs tend to encourage people to live in the area and have families which creates the virtuous cycle of more jobs, more people, and repeat. Immigration also helps the population growth, but that too is fueled by where the jobs are located.

### Future State of the Housing Market

The past does not always predict the future, but let us assume that is does. Forecasting the future rate of growth of the median house price in metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) across the U.S. for the next five years gives insight in to where the current environment may have unique investment opportunities.

Using this forecasted growth combined with our historical analysis we created a housing market rating by msa. The rating takes an equal weight to the factors (XX, XX, XX). An investor would want to choose msa that rank highly as they are favorable markets across all metrics.
